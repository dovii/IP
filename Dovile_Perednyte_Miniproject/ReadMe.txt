Introduction to Programming miniproject




Welcome to the Breakout game! The game was highly inspired by the original Breakout / Atari breakout game.


When you start the program, you are presented with a title screen. The instructions on how to play are presented there. Clicking the left mouse button anywhere on the title screen will transfer you to the actual game screen. There, control the paddle movement with left and right arrow keys. The ball moves on its own and bounces off the paddle, the walls and the tiles and by doing so, it changes direction.

The idea of the game is to control the paddle to manipulate the ball movement and break all of  the top tiles. Each tile you break gives +10 points. The score is displayed at the bottom of the screen during the gameplay.

If the ball goes below the paddle, the game is over and you're presented with an end-game losing screen that only displays your score. If you break all the tiles, you are presented with an end-game winning screen.
